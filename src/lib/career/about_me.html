<p><h3>The best - and often stressful - part about what I do is that new opportunities are constantly appearing on the horizon. Robotics encompasses a wide scope of industries, emerging technologies, and unique roles and it's exciting to be a part of this ever-changing landscape.</h3></p>

<p><h3>I started college thinking I'd follow my parents' footsteps and go on to med school. That instantly went out the window when I took my first physics class and was introduced to the beautiful world of engineering at The George Washington Univeristy. I kept at it and eventually got my masters in Robotics at Northwestern University after enjoying the young professional life in DC for a couple years. Over the years I've been continuously refining my goals, both professionally and personally, and I've come to realize that they overlap in wonderful ways. </h3></p>

<p><h3>Outside of my professional life you can probably find me on a mountain somewhere - snowboarding, hiking or camping. I'd like to say I'm an avid cook but let's not kid ourselves; I do make a fantastic baklava though.</h3></p>
